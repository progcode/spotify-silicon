### SpotifySilicon
For MacOS Big Sur (Apple M1)

Since the original spotify app keeps crashing on mac, I  wrapped up the web player with an electron and turned it into M1 architecture.
The build also includes [widevine support](https://support.spotify.com/article/enable-the-spotify-web-player/) and is signed with [Castlab](https://github.com/castlabs/electron-releases) so you can play DRM-protected content without error.

## Download

The latest version of SpotifySilicon for macOS is available [here](https://github.com/progcode/spotify-silicon/releases).

**Currently only Macos 11.3+ supported**

## Features

- Fully supported online player
- Widevine
